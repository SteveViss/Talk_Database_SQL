Many biologists collect data but they don't care about conservation and utilisation of datasets after their research. Nature announced in December 2013 that two years after the publication almost 17% of datasets are lost each year. In this context, it’s important to store data on well-supported and normalized platforms. This presentation doesn't assume to provide you the best solution but offers some ways to acquire best practices in data conservation for biologists. Some important points and questions are:

- Why is a Relationnal database (RDB) more relevant way to store data in Science ?
- What's Structured Query Language (SQL) ?
- Some examples of tables, relationships and finally, database creation.
- Advantages and disadvantages in using a RDB
- What's a metadata file ? 
- Some general laws in data conservation to keep in mind.

We will finish this meeting with a discussion on OpenData in science.
